client-server networking model
this model, the computer serving data provides resources or services to the other computers on the network.

12 -
 client-server networking model more robustly than before.

13 -
Active Directory Database

14 -
 Star Topology

15 -
Extended Star Topology or a Hierarchical Star Topology

16 -
A Layer 2 switch operates at the data link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model and makes forwarding decisions based on MAC addresses, while a router operates at the network layer (Layer 3) and makes forwarding decisions based on IP addresses, allowing it to interconnect different IP networks.

17 -
A host is a specific type of node that refers to a device, such as a computer or server, connected to a network, while a node is a more general term that encompasses any device or point in a network, including routers, switches, and other infrastructure components in addition to hosts.

18 -
MAN typically covers a city or a large campus, while a WAN spans larger geographic areas, often encompassing multiple cities, regions, or even countries.

19 -
- A message delivered by TCP is called a **"TCP segment"**.
- A message delivered by UDP is called a **"UDP datagram"**.
- Both TCP and UDP operate at the **transport layer** (Layer 4) of the OSI model.

20 -
port number

21 -
UDP is typically used for streaming live video due to its lower latency compared to TCP, prioritizing speed over error-checking.

22 -
packet

23 -
IP (Internet Protocol).

24 -
IP address

25 -
frame

26 -
MAC address

27 -
To  prevents static electricity from damaging sensitive components by safely dissipating any static charge.

28 -
 Physical layer of the OSI model to troubleshoot this problem when checking the LED lights near the computer's network port.

The network adapter (or NIC - Network Interface Card) works at both the Data Link layer (Layer 2) and the Physical layer (Layer 1) of the OSI model.

29 -
Application layer.
Issues related to accessing specific websites are often application-level problems

30 -
the Transport layer.
Skype itself operates at the Application layer. The reliability of Skype connections is influenced by the underlying transport protocols like TCP and UDP

Review Questions 1-30 from Chapter 2:


1. The OUI
2. 255
3. Default gateway
4. SMTP is a connection-based protocol that uses TCP
5. FE80::/10
6. The secondary and primary DNS servers, because the secondary server is requesting zone transfers from the primary server
7. Because no device can have this given IP address, no devices receive the transmission
8. ipconfig/release
9. Root servers
10. CIFS (Common Internet File System)
11. Default port: 3389; Private port range: 49152-65535
12. MX (Mail Exchanger) record
13. 128 bits
14. 546 (UDP)
15. EUI-64 (Extended Unique Identifier-64)
16. POP3 (Post Office Protocol version 3)
17. NAT (Network Address Translation)
18. Decrease the DHCP lease time
19. 169.254.0.1 to 169.254.255.254
20. `ipconfig` (Windows) or `ifconfig` (Linux/Unix) to set the DNS server IP address
21. Port 21
22. `arp -a` (Windows) or `arp -n` (Linux/Unix) to view the ARP table
23. IPv4 loopback address: 127.0.0.1; IPv6 loopback address: ::1
24. `ifconfig` or `ip addr` (Linux/Unix)
25. You need at least one public IP address for SNAT and PAT to share among the five clients.
26. `ping JSMITH` (to resolve the hostname to an IP address)
27. Use a packet analyzer such as Wireshark to capture and analyze NetBIOS traffic.
28. SIP (Session Initiation Protocol), H.323, MGCP.
29. Windows: Use `ping -6` for IPv6 addresses; Linux: Use `ping6` for IPv6 addresses.
30. Protocol: HTTP (Port 80); Command-line utility: `netstat -an` or `ss` to view active network connections. Use a DNS lookup tool to find out who the host is.

Activity 2:

Project 2-1: Create a NAT Translation Table Entry:

1. What is the router’s outside interface IP address?
   - The router's outside interface IP address is 92.110.30.65.

2. What is the router’s inside interface IP address?
   - The router's inside interface IP address is 192.168.11.254.

3. What is the Web site’s public IP address?
   - The Web site's public IP address is 92.110.30.123.

4. What is the private IP address of the backup Web server?
   - The private IP address of the backup Web server is 192.168.11.110.

NAT translation table entries:

ip nat inside source static 192.168.11.100 92.110.30.123
ip nat inside source static 192.168.11.110 92.110.30.123


In these entries:
- The first entry maps the private IP address 192.168.11.100 to the public IP address 92.110.30.123. This is the original Web server.
- The second entry maps the private IP address 192.168.11.110 (backup Web server) to the same public IP address 92.110.30.123.

With these NAT translation entries, requests to 92.110.30.123 will be redirected to either the original Web server (192.168.11.100) or the backup Web server (192.168.11.110) depending on their availability.

Activity 3:

Project 2-3: Manage DNS:

step 2:

i only found "autopush.prod.mozaws.net" which is related to Mozilla as i use Firefox

step 7:
I only see two items.
it could be due to a combination of factors, including DNS cache expiration, browser-level caching, and the use of local DNS servers.
